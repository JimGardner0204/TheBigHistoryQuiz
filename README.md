# The Big History Quiz

The Big History Quiz is a fun interactive quiz that generates questions spanning over the last 1000 years of history. The site is very simplistic in its design and aims to be quick, fun and informative, whilst also teaching users snippets of different periods of history.

### Target Audience 

The site is very generic in its target demographic, the questions are generally targeted at GCSE / A level students in terms of knowledge, however the game has been designed for anybody who has a general interest in history and likes to indulge and learn about different periods, rather than specialising on one period - The design of the site also echoes the above in terms of its simplicity and navigation, it has been designed to focus on the quiz rather than how good the site looks.

### Project Goals

The site has been created to improve my javaScript skills as well as further develop my HTML and CSS knowledge and deployment. The obvious goal in terms of the site is to offer a fun, quick learning game that gives instant satisfaction to the user and keeping the questions to a max number of 7, gives the user the desire to re load and answer further questions, in an attempt to beat their score.

### Features 

### Heading and Logo

- Featured at the top of the page, the heading and icon logo are in focus as soon as the user loads the page, immediately drawing their attention to the name of the quiz.
- The colour, font and font-colour used offer great constrasts against each other as well as the sections beneath.

### Subheading

- The subheading content gives very specific information about what the quiz entails in a simple statement, immediately giving the user instructions for what the quiz entails
- Echoing the above statement, the colours and fonts used contrast well.

### Further Subheading

- The final section of the heading gives the user the green light to start the quiz following the instructions set out above. While the game is self explanatory, I liked the design of having the different colours in this pallete and felt this section gave the user motivation to begin the game.

### Progress Area

- The question number and current score text sits directly below the heading section and immediately tells the user the below question number and their current score (always beginning with question 1 and a current score of 0/7). 
- Again this adds impotus to the instructions for the game and again tells the user there will be 7 questions to answer below.
- I chose to keep the design of this section simplistic with a focus on ease of use and contrast for the user.
