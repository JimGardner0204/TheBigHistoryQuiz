# The Big History Quiz

The Big History Quiz is a fun interactive quiz that generates questions spanning over the last 1000 years of history. The site is very simplistic in its design and aims to be quick, fun and informative, whilst also teaching users snippets of different periods of history.

### Target Audience 

The site is very generic in its target demographic, the questions are generally targeted at GCSE / A level students in terms of knowledge, however the game has been designed for anybody who has a general interest in history and likes to indulge and learn about different periods, rather than specialising on one period - The design of the site also echoes the above in terms of its simplicity and navigation, it has been designed to focus on the quiz rather than how good the site looks.

### Project Goals

The site has been created to improve my javaScript skills as well as further develop my HTML and CSS knowledge and deployment. The obvious goal in terms of the site is to offer a fun, quick learning game that gives instant satisfaction to the user and keeping the questions to a max number of 7, gives the user the desire to re load and answer further questions, in an attempt to beat their score.

### Features 

### Heading and Logo

- Featured at the top of the page, the heading and icon logo are in focus as soon as the user loads the page, immediately drawing their attention to the name of the quiz.
- The colour, font and font-colour used offer great constrasts against each other as well as the sections beneath.

### Subheading

- The subheading content gives very specific information about what the quiz entails in a simple statement, immediately giving the user instructions for what the quiz entails
- Echoing the above statement, the colours and fonts used contrast well.

### Further Subheading

- The final section of the heading gives the user the green light to start the quiz following the instructions set out above. While the game is self explanatory, I liked the design of having the different colours in this pallete and felt this section gave the user motivation to begin the game.

### Progress Area

- The question number and current score text sits directly below the heading section and immediately tells the user the below question number and their current score (always beginning with question 1 and a current score of 0/7). 
- Again this adds impotus to the instructions for the game and again tells the user there will be 7 questions to answer below.
- I chose to keep the design of this section simplistic with a focus on ease of use and contrast for the user.

### Question and Answer Section 

- The question section is where the user will see the quiz question in bold font, with the answer section directly below, comprising of four options with a radio button next to each option, offering the user the chance to pick one of the options.

- Once the user has picked their answer, they click on the submit button located directly below the answers and once submitted, the progress section displaying the 'Question Number' and 'Correct Score' will update accordingly.

- The font size in this section has been increased for mobile users to focus more prominently on the quiz element of the site, with the heading section fonts decreased. This allows a much more user friendly mobile experience, as the questions are easier to read, and answers easier to pick through scaled up radio buttons, and fonts as mentioned. 

### Future Features

- To give users more learning opportunities through the game, I will implement a function to let the user know the correct answer, should they submit a wrong answer, and also congratulate the user on submitting the correct answer. This will obviously allow the user to gain further knowledge from the game through providing information as they progress.
